Component:

```typescript
  case1 = [ , , 1675, , .06, .24, 1, 1.82, , , 837, .06];
```
Give your element a sound by adding the directive as follows:

Template:

``` 
  <div zoundfx trigger="click" [custom]="case1">ðŸ’°</div>

```

Or by using the zzfs function wrapper:

```ts

  playSound: ZzFxFn;
  case4 = [1.5,.5,270,,.1,,1,1.5,,,,,,,,.1,.01];

  async ngOnInit() {
    this.playSound = await Zoundfx.start(0.2);
  }

  onClick() {
    this.playSound(this.case4);
  }
````

### API
Directive inputs:
- vol = 0.1; // Number from 0 to 1;
- trigger = 'onclick'; // String, a name of any event you want to react to
- custom: number[]; // [See example](https://codepen.io/KilledByAPixel/pen/BaowKzv)
